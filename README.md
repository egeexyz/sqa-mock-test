# Automated SQA Test Solution

I wrote this automated test suite for a technical interview I did a few years ago for a certain US company.  Manual testcases are located in the readme of the `./test` folder.

It's written in NodeJS and uses:

- Zombie to crawl the pages
- Mocha to wrangle the test cases
- http-server to serve up the fake website for which to test
